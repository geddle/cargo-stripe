            bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know (e.g.,
            for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded,
            the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure,
            the status will be `verification_failed`. If a payout sent to this bank account fails, we''ll set the status to
            `errored` and will not continue to send [scheduled payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#payout-schedule) until
            the bank details are updated.


            For external accounts, possible values are `new`, `errored` and `verification_failed`. If a payout fails, the

            we''ll set the status to `verification_failed`. Other validations aren''t run against external accounts because

    invoice:
      description: 'Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either

        generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.


        They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments

        that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).


        If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,

        Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note

        that finalizing the invoice,

        [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does

        not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits

        until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last

        webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have

        connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after

        creation to finalize the invoice.


        If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your

        [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),

        Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These

        emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.


        Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the

        amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually

        charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe''s [minimum allowed charge

        per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the

        invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the

        customer''s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.


        More details on the customer''s credit balance are

        [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

            the transaction completes.

            When processing card payments, Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to help you comply with regional legislation and

        [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track
        payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options
        should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.


        For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once.

        for future payments.

        For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer''s card without immediately collecting a payment.

        Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.


        Create a SetupIntent when you''re ready to collect your customer''s payment credentials.

        Don''t maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.

        The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents#intent-statuses)
        as it guides

        you through the setup process.


        Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.

        For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need
        to be run through

        [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection

        to streamline later [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents).

        If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),

        it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.

        We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage)
        on

        PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.


        By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

        Reversing a transfer that was made for a [destination

        charge](/docs/connect/destination-charges) is allowed only up to the amount of

        the charge. It is possible to reverse a

        [transfer_group](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#transfer-options)

        transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the

        reversal.
